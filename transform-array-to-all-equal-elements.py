# You are given an integer array nums of size n containing only 1 and -1, and an integer k.

# You can perform the following operation at most k times:

# Choose an index i (0 <= i < n - 1), and multiply both nums[i] and nums[i + 1] by -1.

# Note that you can choose the same index i more than once in different operations.

# Return true if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal after at most k operations, and false otherwise.

# Note: Please do not copy the description during the contest to maintain the integrity of your submissions.Â©leetcode
