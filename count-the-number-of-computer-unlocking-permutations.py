# You are given an array complexity of length n.

# There are n locked computers in a room with labels from 0 to n - 1, each with its own unique password. The password of the computer i has a complexity complexity[i].

# The password for the computer labeled 0 is already decrypted and serves as the root. All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer, following this information:

# You can decrypt the password for the computer i using the password for computer j, where j is any integer less than i with a lower complexity. (i.e. j < i and complexity[j] < complexity[i])
# To decrypt the password for computer i, you must have already unlocked a computer j such that j < i and complexity[j] < complexity[i].
# Find the number of permutations of [0, 1, 2, ..., (n - 1)] that represent a valid order in which the computers can be unlocked, starting from computer 0 as the only initially unlocked one.

# Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

# Note that the password for the computer with label 0 is decrypted, and not the computer with the first position in the permutation.

# A permutation is a rearrangement of all the elements of an array.
